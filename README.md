# Pystroid Impact

This code has been written as part of a course on wave mechanics, and studies heat diffusion in two dimensions. It implements the heat equation and using differential calculus the heat distribution is simulated over time. By using rough estimations for the diffusivity and thickness of Earth's layers, astroid impact on the Earth's surface is simulated and exported as a GIF animation. This program is meant to be a pedagogical study of the underlying mathematics and by no means strives for accuracy.

The program has a scaling factor to speed up the progress at the cost of resolution. It's not very efficient on the default settings, it could take a couple of minutes to render the GIF. I may update it to be more efficient in the future and I'm considering making a 3D version of this. All suggestions for improvement welcome!
