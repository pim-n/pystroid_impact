# Pystroid Impact

This code has been written as part of a course on wave mechanics, and studies heat diffusion in two dimensions. It implements the heat equation and using differential calculus the heat distribution is simulated over time. By using rough estimations for the diffusivity and thickness of Earth's layers, astroid impact on the Earth's surface is simulated and exported as a GIF animation. This program is meant to be a pedagogical study of the underlying mathematics and by no means strives for accuracy.
